    <p>Hey everyone, my name is Cole Campbell. I have a beautiful wife and and little boy named Stetson.My degree I am pursuing is software engineering. 
         I love the outdoors especially hunting and fishing. We love to go camping on the weekends to find new cool spots.
         Also, My wife and son are my best hunting buddies. I love and enjoy being able to do the things I love with them!
         I love playing and watching sports.I played college baseball at the division two level and I had a lot of fun. 
         I hope to learn more about web design and the different career paths that I could possibly be interested from this taking this class. 
         I have been a member of the Church my entire life and served my mission in Brazil. I love the Book of Mormon and probably 1 Nephi 3:7.
         Roll Tide!</p>
